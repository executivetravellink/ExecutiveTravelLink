        	<h3 class="exe">Executive Travel Link Booking Conditions</h3>
        	<p>Please read the following booking conditions carefully as they govern all bookings made (whether through Executive Travel Link's website or otherwise) with Executive Travel Link, Inc. ("Executive Travel Link") The terms set out below apply when you book through Executive Travel Link hotel accommodation and any other travel components. They apply whether you book one component or more than one component. Booking more than one component does not create a package.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="aboutSec">
            <h3>Making your Booking</h3>
            <p class="booking">Your booking will only be a confirmed booking when Executive Travel Link has issued a confirmation voucher referring to the relevant booking reference number. Executive Travel Link will only do this when it has received payment in full.</p>
            <p>You confirm that you are at least 18 years of age. You must be 21 years of age to check in to Las Vegas hotels. All bookings are personal to you and whether your booking may be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred is dependent on the supplier of the hotel accommodation or other travel components.</p>
            <p>Before you book and before you travel it is also your responsibility to ensure that you and all those travelling with you have a valid passport and any necessary visa and that you have obtained any necessary vaccinations to gain entry to any country you are visiting. It can often take some time to obtain a passport or visa and therefore you should apply well in advance. In peak periods it is advisable to allow at least 4 weeks. Executive Travel Link will have no liability to you if you or any member of your party travels without the correct passport and visa or without the necessary vaccinations.</p>
            <p>Please notify Executive Travel Link at the time of booking if you are of limited mobility, or have any other disability or require special assistance. If so notified, Executive Travel Link will ask its suppliers to accommodate your needs. Executive Travel Link cannot guarantee that its suppliers will be able to accommodate your needs and is not in a position to require them to do so. Even though Executive Travel Link communicates your needs to its suppliers Executive Travel Link does not accept any liability to you for any failure by suppliers to satisfy your needs and will not be liable to you for any losses you may incur in the event that Executive Travel Link or its suppliers are unable to accommodate your requirements.</p>
            <p>The time prior to travel and up until which bookings will be accepted by Executive Travel Link on your behalf is dependent on the supplier of the hotel accommodation or other travel component/s. Bookings for accommodation require at least one full name for each room. Please check your details carefully before you book as incorrect or incomplete details may result in the booking being cancelled and you may be charged a fee to cover any resulting administration costs incurred by Executive Travel Link in having to amend or cancel any bookings made by you.</p>
            <p>Executive Travel Link reserves the right to refuse, at its sole discretion, any booking you seek to make through Executive Travel Link.</p>

            <h3>How We Protect and Secure Your Credit Card Information</h3>
            <p class="full">Payment in full is required at the time of booking. Payment should be made through Executive Travel Link's website or by phone with a credit or debit card.</p>
            <p>Price increases may occur any time prior to full payment being received from you, and you will be liable to pay any such increases in full.</p>
            <p>Prices are shown in the currency requested with rates of exchange calculated on a daily basis. Prices may therefore differ on a daily basis to reflect any movement in exchange rate levels. When you make your booking the exchange rate will be fixed at the time Executive Travel Link issues its confirmation invoice and will apply to any amendments or cancellations within the booking.</p>
            <p>Some hotels, including but not limited to Florida and Las Vegas hotels, may charge you resort fees on arrival at the hotel or at the end of your stay. Resort fees are payable to the hotel and are usually calculated by the hotel on a per night basis. Resort fees are in addition to the amount paid by you to Executive Travel Link at the time of your booking. If you have any questions with regards to potential resort fee charges, please contact our Customer Service who will take reasonable steps to provide you with clarification of your query subject to the information being made available our Site by the supplier</p>

            <h3 class="services">Changes/<br>Cancellations</h3>
            <p>Descriptions of accommodation, facilities and services (including, without limitation, any star rating information provided on Executive Travel Link's website) are based on information obtained from Executive Travel Link's suppliers. Please note that suppliers describe accommodation, facilities and services using varying terminology. For example, some suppliers may describe a room with two separate beds as a "double room" where other suppliers may describe the same room as a "deluxe room". If you are unsure about a description displayed on the Executive Travel Link website, please contact Executive Travel Link's Customer Service who will take reasonable steps to provide you with clarification of your query subject to the information made available to Executive Travel Link by the supplier. Sometimes the facilities described will be withdrawn for reasons such as maintenance, bad weather or lack of demand from guests. Where suppliers advise Executive Travel Link about significant changes to descriptions or about the withdrawal of any significant facility, Executive Travel Link will tell you as soon as possible. Some activities or facilities, may not be available all year round. There may be a charge for some facilities, for example, safety deposit boxes, sun-loungers, parasols, tennis courts, pool tables and air-conditioning. In some places during high season (and even at other times) there is a possibility you will be disturbed by noise from less considerate groups, so please bear this in mind when choosing your destination and accommodation. Any transfer times Executive Travel Link quotes for travel between airport and resorts are approximate and, depending on circumstances, the journey time to your own chosen property may be longer.</p>

            <p>Executive Travel Link's responsibility is to make arrangements for the provision by the relevant suppliers of the components you book, but it does not have any responsibility for the operation of the component itself.</p>
            <p>Executive Travel Link has no liability to you for any dissatisfaction, loss of enjoyment, loss, injury or damage which results from your use of the arrangements booked with Executive Travel Link unless Executive Travel Link has negligently failed to select a normally competent provider of the relevant arrangement.

            <p>Suppliers' Conditions</p>
            <p>Executive Travel Link's suppliers have their own booking conditions, and you will be bound by these, so far as the relevant supplier is concerned. These suppliers' conditions will also apply to your contract with Executive Travel Link, and in the event of any conflict between the suppliers' conditions and Executive Travel Link's conditions, the suppliers' conditions will prevail other than in the event of any conflict with Clause 5 above in which event Clause 5 will prevail, save to the extent that any term in the suppliers' conditions is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, in which event Executive Travel Link's conditions will prevail. Some of the Suppliers' conditions may limit or exclude liability on the part of the relevant supplier and, by virtue of their application to your contract with Executive Travel Link, may also limit or exclude Executive Travel Link's liability to you.

        <section class="aboutSec">
            <h3 class="com">Complaints</h3>
            <p>Complaints regarding hotel accommodation or other supplier's services must be brought to the attention of the hotel or supplier's management as soon as possible during your stay. If the complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction, you must notify Executive Travel Link immediately on the telephone number provided on your Voucher.</p>
            <p>If you consider that your complaint is not dealt with adequately at the time, you must notify Executive Travel Link as soon as possible in writing and in any event within (30) thirty days of your return, quoting your original booking reference and providing all relevant information about your complaint.</p>
            <p>Please note that failure to follow the above procedure may reduce or extinguish any rights you have to claim compensation from Executive Travel Link, or from the relevant supplier. Any such rights will be reduced or extinguished particularly if, had you followed the above procedures, you or Executive Travel Link or its suppliers could have taken steps to reduce any loss or damage suffered or entirely prevented it from being suffered. Further, it is difficult and sometimes impossible properly to investigate a complaint if it is not notified reasonably quickly once your trip is over. Your rights to claim compensation may therefore also be reduced or extinguished, should any delay in your complaint being notified during or after your trip, prevent the carrying out of a proper investigation.</p>
